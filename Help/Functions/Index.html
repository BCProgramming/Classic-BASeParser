Functions perform some operation on their arguments, and will usually return a result. BASeParser's Core handlers
expose a large number of functions that were inspired by equivalent functions in programming languages, such as Visual Basic and C++, as well as Perl. You'll find functions that deal with trigonometry, like Sin,Cos, and Tan, as well as functions that deal will statistics, such as Mean, and Avg.
