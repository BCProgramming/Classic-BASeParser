BASeParser XP Core Functions Operators


The Core Plugin of BASeParser XP, BPCoreOpFunc, implements a large number of Operators and functions.


*Note*

Some Objects that implement IOperable, CComplex, for example, might add their own handling to certain operators and functions.
Additionally, if the operand does not support arrays, the core plugin will automatically call itself recursively for each item in the array and subsequently return a array consisting of the results.
A example:

{1,2}-{4,5}

would return:

{{-3,-4},{-2,-3}}

which you can think of as:

{{1-4,1-5},{2-4,2-5}}


This is a very useful feature that can make what used to require a loop a single line. Additionally it supports any operator that is implemented by the Core plugin. note that not all plugins may include this ability, however.



OPERATORS:


+

Adds two Values together. Fairly self explanatory. If either operand is a string variable, the other will be coerced to a string value. for example:

38+"hi" would return "38hi"

-

Subtracts the second operand from the first operand. Also can be used as a Unary minus to indicate negative numbers.

*

Multiplication. Multiplies the two values, returning the result. C

/

Division. Divides the first operand by the second operand.

\ and DIV

integer division. returns the whole portion after division.
