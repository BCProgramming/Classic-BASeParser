BASeParser XP Distribution
--------------------------


After much deliberation, I have finally decided to simply use a ZIP file and some helper batch files for distribution of my new flagship library, BASeParser XP.
Each new release will add-on to previous releases, perhaps creating new files here and there.



INSTALLATION
------------

BASeParser XP, as of this current release, requires a manual setup. Copy the BASeParser.dll file somewhere on your hard drive, ideally a folder in the program files directory, but anywhere will work just fine. Also copy the included regall.bat, and run it from the location of the BASeParser DLL.

It might not work at this point. When attempting to create an object that resides in the library, a "activeX component cannot create object" error may occur. To resolve this error, ensure you have the following libraries installed on the machine:




-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeLib Information..........................TLBINF32.DLL
Microsoft Script Control 1.0.................msscript.ocx
Microsoft XML, v3.0..........................msxml3.dll
Microsoft Scripting Runtime..................scrrun.dll
Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5...vbscript.dll


For your convenience, I have included these files within the distribution archive. Just copy them to the system32 folder and register them as required.
