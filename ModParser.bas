'BASeParser
'View development log for notes, as well as a sad description of a fairly long chain of bad luck I
'had with my computers, through no fault of them. Although, maybe from me.


'TODO: tuples; like:

'{A,B}=Function()


'THE CODE

'Hopefully, you have all the modules and classes BASeParser needs. I do use quite a lot of classes
'from my other projects, so forgive me if I forget one or two the first time I release the code.



'ModCipher
'HEE HEE! I only use this for a certain easter egg.
'Anyways, the ModCipher module simply contains a few Cryptography functions, they aren't exactly advanced,
'but they seem to do the job well. And since I only include the hashed version to test, there is no evidence
'of the original password I passed to the cipher function. I assume it isn't impossible to reverse-engineer it, since I
'give the code that creates the hash. But- just look at it!


'The idea here is to prevent anybody stealing my code and claiming it as their own.
'Thatr is probably one of my greater fears as far as this project goes.


'ModDebug
'one-liner that I include with CDebug. No comment. Except that. That was one comment.

'ModImprove
'a few improvements on the intrinsic VB functions, such as ASC and CHR.
'for example, CHR can take multiple arguments.

'ModSort
'Implements the sorting and binary search procedures used by the BPCoreOpFunc Core Plugin.

'ModTiming
'Profiling stuff. QueryPerformanceTimer, a Timer function replacement, etc.
'Probably just as well to put it in ModImprove...

'BPCoreOpFunc
    'the Core Parser Plugin.
    


'CComplex
    'implements Complex numbers. I must apologize, as this Class isn't exactly portable to any other project, on account of it's dependency on CParser's PerformOperation.
    
'CDataList

    'planned improvement on current Array manipulation. probably won't be done for a while, since
    'the current method works fine.
    
'CDebug

    'I think this class is pretty cool. It is in several of my projects. When it is instantiated it creates two debugging files(given the conditional constant, "NODEBUGLOG", isn't defined.)
    'one, a Debug log, is written with all the output from the Post method. Another, a speed profiling CSV file, will contain timing data on ALL functions which call the CDebug
    'object's PushP and PopP procedures. It will have such things as the total number of times called, total time, and average time. of all of these,
    'average time is probably the most useful. I find myself deleting megabytes of these log and profiling files
    'after a few debug sessions.

'CFormItem

    'represents a single token within a expression. For example, each basic token (string,number, etc..) is a IT_VALUE. every function is a
    'IT_FUNCTION whose "Value" property (on the formitem) is a array of CParser objects whose expressions are the function arguments.
    'Operators are IT_OPERATOR types. a Object access operator, @, is IT_OBJACCESS, and array access, IT_ARRACCESS, etc.
    
'CFraction
    
    'used to represent Fractions. As I write this, it doesn't support IOperable's PerformOperation interface method, but does support
    'the toString() method.
    
'CFunction

    'represents a Function. These objects are handled by the intrinsic FunctionHandler Class.
    'found within the CFunctions collection Class
    
'CFunctions

    'collection of CFunction objects. Enough said.
    
'Colour

    'represents a Colour. very versatile. I wrote it quite some time ago.
    
'CMatrix
    
    'Self-explanatory.
    




'OK. I just compiled to Native Code, optimizing for Small code, and I got a DLL that was 1.2 Megabytes. Not good.
'I guess I'll be compiling to P-Code until I find out why. probably should remove dead-code.

#Const BASEPARSER = 1
'ANYWAY...

'This project is my Expression evaluation library. My original version was lost through an accidental
'drive repartition. Yes I had a backup. Well, it WAS my backup. The original was so chock full of features,
'I didn't think I'd be able to re-create them all in my new version. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, this version not
'only has more features, but it is a lot easier to add more, as well as virtually painless to create new functions,
'since it supports external plugins. (it is a pain in the neck creating large libraries of functions, however, due to
'all the work that must be done validating the function parameters.)




'a note about Parse Stack Caching:

'After having the Debug-logging feature active for some time, I have reviewed the output from sessions in which I wasn't breaking into the development environment (which would become part of the code timing)
'and realized that, even though it was called the fewest number of times out of the functions I profile, the RipFormula() routine had the highest TOTAL time. This was deeply concerning.
'the problem was not necessarily  badly written code, but rather the large number of things that need to be checked for. In order to minimize the number of times RipFormula needs to be executed, I have devised the
'Parse Cache. The parse Cache is activated for all expressions containing more than 6 Formula items. the time it takes to parse such an expression seems to average out to about a tenth of a second, whereas executing that built stack takes less than a hundredth of that.
'what happens is the Parse Cache will contain a queue of Parsed Stacks. For example, evaluation of the expression:
'"Sin(X)/Sqr(Y)/(2*3)+4" contain 7 formula items, the Sin and Sqr functions and the division operator between them (three)
'as well as the additional division and the parenthesized expression (the parenthesized expression contains three items, but these don't count) and finally the addition and the literal 4.
'once this is parsed into the internal data structure optimized for execution, the parser will realize that it contained more than 6 items(the value 6 is somewhat arbitrary here, since it can be changed)
'and push it onto the optimized expression queue. The interesting thing is, since each CParser will create additional "child" parser objects for such things, and each of these parsers will itself check the global
'parse cache, the code will automatically allow for future cache hits on expressions
'such as "Sqr(Sin(X)/Sqr(Y)/(2*3)+4)"
'unfortunately, the entire expression must appear as it does in the parse cache- that is, as a separate entity. For example, this expression
'would not have ANY cache hits (given that the parse cache contains a stack for the aforementioned example expression:

'Sin(X)/Sqr(Y)/(2*3)+4/2

'Adding such a feature is slightly more difficult than easy. the Parse routine could inspect each cached item to see if
'it's expression is a substring of the current expression. if so, it could then replace said subexpression with a bracketed form.
'The problem, of course, comes about when we have an optimized version of something like "3-4+3", and try to execute:
'5*3-4+3+2  (which equals 16)
'the parser will think, hey, that there 3-4+3 has already been parsed! lets do this:
'5*(3-4+3)+2 which equals 12)
'it was due to this problem and trying to iron out such inconsistencies that forced me to
'abandon any such scheme. The checks to ensure parenthesizing the portion of the expression in question
'could highly likely surpass any prescribed gain. Of course, it could always appear in a later version...

'as Parenthesized expressions and function arguments (not to mention list elements)





'The core operators and functions are documented within the BPCoreOpFunc class. Technically, the CParser object is clueless about any operator-
'it simply asks the plugin if a given location within the string contains the operator. Take note that unlike my old version, a operator called ++ could exist.
'in fact, one called ** is defined as the same as ^)

'(the following is done)
'TODO:\\ I think a very useful feature would be to extend unary support to allow for them AFTER
'the thing they work with. The only difficulty is I would once again
'need to change the IEvalEvents interface, by changing the isUnary argument from a boolean to
'a custom Enumeration (UnaryTypeConstants) It should be much more painless.


'The syntax is fully comprehended by the parser however.

'VARIABLES:

'variables are fully handled by the execution code. a variable is defined as a non-numeric value that has been parsed.
'for example, the following are variables:

'A, VARIABLE,VARCODE

'if the supposed variable name is immediately preceded by a bracket, however, it is then parsed out as a Function with that name.
'if a variable is present at any level in an expression, it prevents that expression from being fully optimized.
'LISTS:
'a special token is the list, defined by a group of arguments delimited by "{" and "}". These are replaced by a Function call
'to a function called "ARRAY". obviously, the core  operator/Function plugin must be loaded.

'UNARY OPERATOR:

'unary operators are much better handled in this version of BASeParser. This version uses the same logic to parse out unary operators,
'but it treats that operator as a unary operator if it either followed another operator or is the first item in the expression.


'OPTIMIZATION:

'again, a new feature in this BASeParser, is the intrinsic ability for it to optimize any given expression.
'optimization can occur at any level of an expression. For example, the following expression:

'"Sin(Cos(Tan(5+2)))+(5/3*2/5)+Sin(Cos(T))"
'will optimize the Sin() call, the numeric expression, but not the last Sin call. The last Sin call cannot be
'optimized because it contains a Cos Function call that is not constant, which is because of the T.
'(Variables, by definition, are never constant).

'IMPORTANT NOTE:
'before you go criticizing my use of Variants so very often
'in this library, remember that in order to handle all the different
'types of data the parser will encounter, it needs to store it. (duh)
'Variants actually aren't as slow as I thought, but unlike a lot
'of variant advocates say, it causes a heck of a lot of bugs.

'Also of importance is that this library goes relatively slow when
'Debugging is on. This is primarily due to the fact that the library makes excessive calls
'to CDebug.Post, and that method writes to a log file. Often, after a short 5 or 10 minute test, the log can bloat to
'several megabytes. The Debugging Constant is "NODEBUG". If this is defined, then every procedure in
'the CDebug Class becomes a stub.

'Overview of the engine.

'OK, first you send it the Expression.
'Eventually (after a few gyrations with ensuring there are spaces around operators)
'we start ripping the formula-
'now, ripping the formula does involve some communication with our
'set of plugins (which are installed(added to the collection) when the CParser object's
'"Create()" method is called), in the logic to determine what tokens are operators and so forth,
'not to mention interfacing with Core plugins to find custom itemtypes.
'As an example, what happens with this expression:

'5+Sin(A)

'Since Sin will be found to be a function in the Core Operator/Function Plugin, we will end up
'with this InFix:

'IT_VALUE=5,IT_OPERATOR=+,IT_FUNCTION=SIN
'note the absence of any reference to the actual arguments of the SIN function, this is because the
'parser creates ANOTHER parser object for each function argument.

'Anyway, now, BuildStack_Infix builds the RPN stack from the essentially unintelligible Infix stack, and we end of with:

'IT_OPERATOR=+;IT_VALUE=5;IT_FUNCTION=SIN


'and thus the parse is completed. This stack will be stored in the global collection of Stacks, and cached
'so any other parses will happen much faster.


'And then the fun begins with the execution....








'Once ripformula is completed, BuildStack_Infix changes the build stack from Infix notation
'to the "native" Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) that we can execute.
'(little todo for myself, possibly add other parse abilities, such as Postfix and such.)
